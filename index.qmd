Hello there! I'm Muhamad Ameer Noor, and this is my space dedicated to the exciting world of geospatial analytics. Join me on this journey as I delve into the fascinating realm of spatial data analysis and its applications.

## What to Expect

On this webpage, I'll be sharing insights, discoveries, and projects related to geospatial analytics that I learned from ISSS624 - Applied Geospatial Analytics Course under [Prof Kam Tin Seong](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/kam-tin-seong-486) during my [MITB Programme at Singapore Management University](https://masters.smu.edu.sg/programme/master-of-it-in-business). Whether you're a fellow enthusiast, a student, or just curious about the power of location-based data, you're in the right place!

## Learning Journey

I'll document my experiences and challenges as I navigate through ISSS624 Geospatial Analytics. Expect a mix of tutorials and case studies that showcase the practical applications of geospatial analytics.
